                    <p class="procedure-font">The samples were solely collected during the fall, as the results only represent one season. The 10 sites were visited on different days over a timespan of a month. On October 2nd, 2021, samples were collected from Gravelly Brook, Big Brook, and Marlu Lake. On October 3rd, samples were collected from Hatfield Swamp, Great Piece Meadows, the Passaic River, and Ramapo River. On November 6th, samples were collected from Shark River Park Pond and Holmdel Park Pond. On November 14th, samples were collected from Lake Topanemus. At each site, three containers were used, with the samples being gathered in slightly different spots around the source. Using gloves, the containers were rinsed in the freshwater source three times then filled an inch or two from the top. The lids were put back on and the containers were labeled with a piece of masking tape with a black Sharpie marker. The containers were brought back to the car where the pH levels were tested within 15 minutes. Then, the containers were be stored in a cooler with ice. The thermometer in the cooler was occasionally checked to ensure the temperature was ≤6 °C. After each sample collection, the containers were stored in a fridge before testing.

                    <p class="procedure-font">pH was tested on-site within 15 minutes or at home if the site was less than 15 minutes away. The Vernier Tris-Compatible Flat pH Sensor was connected to a laptop using the Vernier LabQuest Mini, and data was collected using the Logger Lite software. The lower 1” tip of the sensor was removed from the electrode storage bottle by gently pulling the tip from the suction lid of the bottle. To rinse the probe, the tip was dipped into distilled water in one of the Rubbermaid plastic containers and the squeeze bottles were used. The sensor was calibrated using the 4 and 7 standards for a two-point calibration. In the calibration dialog box on the Logger Lite software, after the sensor was dipped into the first pH standard and the displayed voltage was stabilized, the first known calibration value was entered. The process was repeated for the second calibration point. Before the sensor was dipped into a different solution or sample, the tip was rinsed with distilled water again. When making measurements, the tip of the probe was dipped in the sample, and the measurement was read after about 30 seconds or until the pH value displayed stabilized. After using the sensor, it was rinsed and dried, and the tip was stored in the electrode storage bottle.

The probe was rinsed with distilled water from a plastic container and from the squeeze bottles whenever it was dipped into a different solution or sample. To calibrate the probe, the 1413 µs and 12.88 mS conductivity calibration solution included with the tester were used. In the calibration mode, the probe was dipped into the first calibration solution, and the calibration button was pressed. The process was repeated for the second calibration solution used. To make measurements, the probe was turned on and the mode button was pressed to switch between the conductivity, salinity, and total dissolved solids modes. The probe was stirred gently in the sample and then held steady for about 10 seconds or until a stable reading could be taken. After use, the probe was rinsed and dried, and the cap was put on.

The test strips were dipped into the sample, and the excess water was shaken off when the test strip was removed. After waiting for a set amount of time, the color of the test strip was compared to the color chart on the side of the containers. Each container specified the amount of time to dip the test strip in the water and how long to wait before matching with the color chart. For nitrite and nitrate ions, the test strip was dipped in the sample for 2-3 seconds and was compared to the color chart after 30 seconds. The nitrate reading was displayed in the lower square and the nitrite reading was displayed in the upper square. For zinc, the test strip was dipped in the sample for 3 seconds and was compared to the color chart after 20 seconds. For copper, the test strip was dipped in the sample for 15 seconds and compared to the color chart after 30 seconds. For the overall heavy metals check, the test strip was dipped in the sample for 30 seconds and was compared to the color chart after 2 minutes. After one use, the test strip was thrown out. After all testing was complete, the samples were properly disposed of and the containers were washed.

The calculated data table was set up in the same manner, except for each type of freshwater, the average of the two sources was displayed by calculating the mean of the 6 trials. A total of nine summative data tables were created for the nine dependent variables. The mean, standard deviation, and variance were calculated using the functions in Google Sheets. For the statistical data, nine one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests were performed. If the p-value was less than the alpha value of 0.05, there was at least one significantly different condition and subset t-tests were performed. The T.TEST function in Google Sheets was used to perform the t-tests. The conclusions drawn from the ANOVA and t-tests were recorded.
