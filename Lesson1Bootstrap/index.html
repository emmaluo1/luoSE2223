                    <p class="lead overview-font" id="ovPadLeft">The increasing salinity and contamination of freshwater is a growing environmental concern that is driven by human activity that increases salt pollution. Salt and contaminants can interact and often induce other contaminants to enter the water depending on the type of ions and the ecosystem involved. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine which type of freshwater is most affected by human activity to understand the differences in environments and contaminant interactions. The hypothesis is that human activity has varying effects on different types of freshwater and their concentration of salt and other contaminants because of the varying current speeds and compositions of the freshwater systems. Samples were collected from the five types of freshwater: streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and wetlands. pH, conductivity, salinity, total dissolved solids, nitrite, nitrate, zinc, copper, and overall heavy metal levels were the nine water quality parameters tested. Statistical data analysis was performed to determine if any condition of the independent variable had significantly higher levels for at least five dependent variables in order to support the hypothesis. The results of the data analysis did not support the research hypothesis. While rivers had the highest levels for five dependent variables, it was only significantly higher than all of the other conditions for pH levels. However, if the scope of this study was increased by collecting samples from more sources and from a wider region, there may be more trends in the data and accurate measurements. Overall, this study contributes to the documentation of freshwater salinization and may pave the way for future research addressing similar topics and regulations for protecting freshwater systems.
