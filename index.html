                    <p class="lead overview-font pad-right" id="ovPadLeft">The increasing salinity and contamination of freshwater is a growing environmental concern that is driven by human activity that increases salt pollution. Salt and contaminants can interact and often induce other contaminants to enter the water depending on the type of ions and the ecosystem involved. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine which type of freshwater is most affected by human activity to understand the differences in environments and contaminant interactions. The hypothesis is that human activity has varying effects on different types of freshwater and their concentration of salt and other contaminants because of the varying current speeds and compositions of the freshwater systems. Samples were collected from the five types of freshwater: streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and wetlands. pH, conductivity, salinity, total dissolved solids, nitrite, nitrate, zinc, copper, and overall heavy metal levels were the nine water quality parameters tested. Statistical data analysis was performed to determine if any condition of the independent variable had significantly higher levels for at least five dependent variables in order to support the hypothesis. The results of the data analysis did not support the research hypothesis. While rivers had the highest levels for five dependent variables, it was only significantly higher than all of the other conditions for pH levels. However, if the scope of this study was increased by collecting samples from more sources and from a wider region, there may be more trends in the data and accurate measurements. Overall, this study contributes to the documentation of freshwater salinization and may pave the way for future research addressing similar topics and regulations for protecting freshwater systems.

                    <p class="lead overview-font pad-right" id="ovPadLeft">Despite the increased awareness of freshwater salinization, there are still unanswered questions and room for future research. Priority research questions include what are the causes of freshwater salinization, its physiological and ecosystem functioning effects, how salt toxicity is modified, and how it can be regulated (Cañedo-Argüelles et al.). With the increased documentation of salinity and chemical concentrations, there can be more research into the extent and severity of salinity and other stressors. Additionally, it is important to understand how chemicals interact and how ecosystems will continue to be impacted. This study will analyze how freshwater salinization affects different types of freshwater to understand the differences in environment and interactions. This is necessary for developing local, regional, or global regulations and prediction models. From the experiments, more data can be contributed to the documentation of salinization and for understanding the interactions between ions.
